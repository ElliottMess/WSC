## About this package

This package offers functions to process data according to the WSC guidelines.

Functions rely on the existence of two global analysis plans:

* The general WSC analysis plan (AP) than can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TKxD_DyBTTN6onxYiooqtcI_TVSwPfeE-t7ZHK1zzMU/edit?usp=sharing) or as an object in the package (```WSC::WSC_AP```)
* The WASH Insecurity Score (WIS) analysis plan that can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UCr-G9gD6YZmiOHDoP95qiMkEqi9jMG3lfzzv7WCFnM/edit?usp=sharing) (in multiple sheets) or as an object in the package (```WSC::WIS_water```, ```WSC::WIS_sanitation```, ```WSC::WIS_final```)


To contextualise the analysis to the environment in which the WSC is applied, users should create:

* A context specific AP that links the indicators in the WSC AP to the datasets used in the context analysis. See an example [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pv1BBf32faE6J5tryubhVOsQJfGXaDb2t23KWGab52U/edit?usp=sharing) or in ```WSC::context_AP```.

The data is stored on googlesheets to ease the remote use of the package, but the functions use ```data.frames``` as inputs.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of WSC from [github](https://github.com/ElliottMess/WSC) with:
``` r
devtools::install_github("ElliottMess/WSC")
```


## Main Functions

The package contains three main functions:

    1. WSC::score_WIS(): scores a dataset according to the calculation model.
    2. WSC::agg_score(): aggregates results at a specified administrative level
    3. WSC::twenty_rule(): applies the 20% rule to a specified datasets
    4. WSC::assign_hiAdmin_loAdmin(): assign results from a higher administrative level to a lower one in an uniform way (all lower units part of a higher administrative unit have the same value).
    5. WSC::score_df_AP(): Score dataset according to the Analysis Plan (AP) phases.
    6. WSC::scoring_var(): Score individual variables according to AP.
    
Working examples are provided for all the functions based on the datasets documented within the package.

### 1. score_WIS

```{r score_WIS, message=FALSE}
library(WSC)
library(knitr)

WIS_scored <- score_WIS(data = WSC::bfa_msna_2020, context_AP = WSC::context_AP, context = "bfa_2020",
         WSC_AP = WSC::WSC_AP, WIS_water = WSC::WIS_water, WIS_sanitation = WSC::WIS_sanitation,
         WIS_final = WSC::WIS_final)

kable(head(WIS_scored))

```

### 2. agg_score

```{r agg_score, message=FALSE}
library(WSC)
library(knitr)

score_agg_admin2 <- agg_score(context = "bfa_2020", context_AP = WSC::context_AP,
          WSC_AP = WSC::WSC_AP, data = WSC::bfa_msna_2020)

kable(head(score_agg_admin2))

```

### 3. twenty_rule

```{r twenty_rule, message=FALSE}
library(WSC)
library(knitr)

admin2_twenty_ruled <- twenty_rule(data = score_agg_admin2, col_score = "indicator",
            col_label = "choice", name_final_score = "score_final",
            col_agg = "admin2", col_value = "value")

kable(head(admin2_twenty_ruled))

```

### 4. assign_hiAdmin_loAdmin

```{r assign_hiAdmin_loAdmin, message=FALSE}
library(WSC)
library(knitr)

admin1_admin2_agg <- assign_hiAdmin_loAdmin(HiAdmin_df = WSC::bfa_smart_2019_admin1, HiAdmin_name = "admin1",
                       HiAdmin_df_name = "smart_2019_admin1",
                       context = "bfa_2020", context_AP = WSC::context_AP,
                       WSC_AP = WSC::WSC_AP, LoAdmin_df = WSC::bfa_msna_2020, LoAdmin_name = "admin2")



kable(head(admin1_admin2_agg))

```

### 5. score_df_AP

```{r score_df_AP, message=FALSE}
library(WSC)
library(knitr)

area_df <- score_df_AP(data = WSC::bfa_smart_2019_admin1, data_name = "smart_2019_admin1",
         data_type = "area",
         agg_level = "admin1", context = "bfa_2020", context_AP = WSC::context_AP,
         WSC_AP = WSC::WSC_AP)

hh_df <- score_df_AP(data = WSC::bfa_msna_2020, data_name = "msna_2020",
         data_type = "hh",
         agg_level = "admin1", context = "bfa_2020", context_AP = WSC::context_AP,
         WSC_AP = WSC::WSC_AP)



kable(head(hh_df))

```



## About the WSC
The WASH Severity Classification (WSC) is a new interagency global initiative led by the [Global WASH Cluster](http://washcluster.net/), [UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/), and [IMPACT Initiatives](impact-initiatives.org/).
Developed at the global level through a participatory process, the WSC project aims to develop a standardized approach to classifying the severity of WASH needs and vulnerabilities across contexts.
For more information, contact wsc@reach-initiative.org.

As the documentation relating to the WSC is still under development, direct links to them are replaced by placeholder_link.
